			"blobNotes": "<h2>Combat</h2><p>By default, every monster (with a few exceptions), has the Fighting skill—a generic combat skill covering all manner of strikes, kicks, claws, teeth, tentacles, elbows, head butts, etc. If the being is able to use melee weapons, the Fighting skill should be used for those as well. Be creative in how you use and portray these attacks. Each entry describes how the monster would normally attack, and key words, such as bite or kick, are provided to give Keepers ideas on how best to describe differing attacks. The environment can also be added to the description of attacks and damage: an investigator could be crushed between an elephant and a tree; a ghoul could crack open an investigator’s head against a gravestone; and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>While a monster’s standard attack could be used every time, this can become repetitive and dull. Using the damage listed for the monster’s standard Fighting attack frees the Keeper from having to adjust the damage with each variation, allowing the Keeper greater freedom to describe the monster’s attacks in creative and imaginative ways. The Keeper is neither gaining an advantage or disadvantage in varying the monster’s attacks—he or she is making the story more exciting and engaging.</p><blockquote><p>A deep one has the following attack listed:</p><p>Fighting 45% (22/9), damage 1D6 + damage bonus (1D4)</p><p>Using this skill, the Keeper could describe a successful attack in any of the following ways. Regardless of the manner of attack, for ease of play, the same 1D6 + 1D4 damage is dealt.</p><ul><li>The deep one rakes its claws across Harvey’s chest, slicing through his clothes.</li><li>The deep one charges into Harvey, body-slamming him.</li><li>Kicking out backwards like a horse, the deep one slams its foot into Harvey’s midriff.</li><li>The deep one grabs Harvey’s jacket, thrusting Harvey’s head into the crumbling plaster of the wall in the Gilman House Hotel.</li></ul></blockquote><h3>Monsters and Maneuvers</h3><p>Maneuvers (mnvr) use the monster’s Fighting skill. Build is an important factor for maneuvers; if the opponent is 3 Build points above that of an attacker, a maneuver is ineffective. Any monster of Build 2 or greater is never going to have penalty dice when using a maneuver against a human being. The largest opponent a human (maximum Build 2) could take on with a maneuver would be Build 4 (horse, elder thing, etc.)—even then, the largest of humans would attack with 2 penalty dice due to the difference in Build.&nbsp;</p><p>In combat, monsters can use the same range of maneuvers open to humans. The Keeper should visualize the monster simply trap their opponents with their bulk, crushing the life out of them. Opponents that are seized or grabbed are held until they succeed in an opposed STR roll or maneuver of their own to free themselves.</p><p>With a successful maneuver, a monster could:</p><ul><li>Knock an investigator to the floor, gaining a bonus die on its next attack if the investigator is still prone.</li><li>Push an investigator out of a window or over a cliff.</li><li>Disarm an investigator, knocking that annoying \"boom-stick\" out of his or her hands.</li><li>Grasp hold of an investigator with a tentacle, gaining a bonus die to cause harm by constriction or pummeling the held investigator against a wall on the next attack.</li><li>If the monster is large enough, it could seize an investigator and carry him or her off next round, perhaps flying away or carrying the held investigator aloft with a writhing tentacle.</li><li>A standard car has Build 5, so any monster with Build 3+ has the potential to damage vehicles. Larger monsters might even seize hold of a vehicle containing the investigators, much like an angry child throwing a cereal box.</li></ul><h3>Monsters and Fighting Back</h3><p>Unless a monster is trying to escape or being especially crafty, you should respond to investigator attacks by fighting back rather than dodging. When fighting back, a monster should generally use its basic Fighting skill. A monster that has more than one attack per round may also dodge or fight back that number of times before its enemies are granted a bonus die for outnumbering it (see <b>Outnumbered</b>). Thus a ghoul with three attacks can fight back three times before its attackers gain a bonus die to their attacks. Some Mythos entities can never be outnumbered by investigators.</p><h3>Killing Monsters</h3><p>Rather than declaring that a monster or opponent is dead, the Keeper is encouraged to describe what the investigators can see—the monster has stopped moving, it appears to be melting, a thick green fluid is welling up from a hole in the side of its body, and so on. Remember that these monsters are strange and alien beings; determining death should not be simple. Some monsters (when reduced to unconsciousness or zero hit points) may appear to be dead, only to rise again moments or hours later to inflict a grisly revenge on their attackers. Only a successful First Aid or Medicine roll will determine for sure whether a being is alive or dead.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/98440777/g9CHvm_JVnFEuqsGTHW2vg/med.png?1575345890\"><br></p><blockquote><p>A dark young is fighting a group of investigators. The dark young may initiate five separate attacks on its turn in the DEX order, one of which may be its trample attack.&nbsp;</p><p><b>First attack:</b> The dark young raises one of its many hooves to stamp on a hapless investigator. The investigator’s player rolls a failure on the attempt to dodge the attack, while the Keeper rolls a Regular success on the dark young’s Fighting skill, and deals damage equal to damage bonus (4D6), for 11 damage.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Second attack:</b> This time the dark young lashes out with a tentacle to attempt to grasp an investigator. This uses a fighting maneuver; of course the dark young has a larger build than any investigator, so does not take any penalty dice on the maneuver. The Keeper rolls an Extreme success. The investigator fails to dodge and is seized and lifted high in the air, being drained of 12 points of Strength. The dark young will keep the investigator held until the poor unfortunate has been completely drained.</p><p><b>Third attack:</b> Two of the investigators are getting into their pickup truck. Remember that the dark young has an INT of 70, as much as most investigators, so it may well know what a pickup truck is. It uses its trample attack on the pickup. At present, the vehicle is static and so the Keeper allows an automatic success, but makes the attack roll in case of a fumble or Extreme success. The attack would normally have failed but was not a fumble, so in this case the attack against a stationary object is successful. This deals (6D6) 17 damage. Each 10 full points of damage reduces the build of a vehicle by 1 point.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Fourth attack: </b>Annoyed at how tough the pickup truck proved to be, the Keeper decides that the dark young will attempt to flip the vehicle. The pickup has a build of 6 (it has 1 point of damage, but its listed build is still 6), 1 higher than the dark young’s build; the dark young can use its fighting maneuver but must apply 1 penalty die. Again, the car is not moving so unless the Keeper rolls a fumble, the attack will be successful. The Keeper rolls 24 or 14 (with the penalty die) which, taking the higher roll, still gives a Hard success. <b>Builds </b>states that a being is just able to lift something that is of 1 build larger than itself. The dark young manages to tip the pickup truck over onto its side, with a crash.</p><p>For its final attack the dark young simply lashes out with a kick at a nearby investigator, and the Keeper rolls a Hard success. The player rolls a Hard success to dodge, so the investigator avoids the blow.</p></blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

			"blobNotes": "<h2>Sanity Points&nbsp;<span>and SAN Rolls</span></h2><p>Sanity points should be tracked carefully, as the number can change up and down throughout the game. When investigators encounter a sanity-threatening situation, the Keeper may call for a Sanity roll. Each player whose investigator experiences this source of horror rolls 1D100. A success is a roll equal to or less than the investigator’s current Sanity points. Bonus dice and penalty dice are not applied to Sanity rolls (with one exception, <b>Self-Help</b>).&nbsp;</p><p><b>Note:</b> If using the optional rule for spending Luck points, these may not be spent on Sanity rolls.</p><p>A successful roll means that the investigator loses no Sanity points, or only a minimal amount. A failed Sanity roll always means the investigator loses Sanity points. The amount lost depends on the spell, book, entity, or situation encountered.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/98224244/e_FHELl6NHyjIIc05DCgvQ/med.png?1575139633\"><br><i>The Mythos is anathema to the human mind.</i></p><p>In published Call of Cthulhu scenarios, Sanity loss rolls are shown as two numbers or rolls separated by a slash, for instance: SAN 1/1D4+1. The number to the left of the slash is the number of Sanity points lost if the Sanity roll succeeds. The die roll to the right of the slash is the number of Sanity points lost if the Sanity roll is failed. Sometimes this may be written as SAN 0/1D4; in this particular case, a successful Sanity roll means no Sanity points are lost, but if the roll is failed, the investigator loses 1D4 Sanity points.</p><p>Failing a Sanity roll always causes the investigator to lose self-control for a moment, at which point the Keeper should choose an involuntary action for the investigator. For example:</p><ul><li><b>Jump in fright</b>—causing the investigator to drop something (spectacles, flashlight, gun, book, etc.)</li><li><b>Cry out in terror</b>—drawing attention, saying something inappropriate.</li><li><b>Involuntary movement</b>—swerving the steering wheel dangerously to one side, throwing up one’s hands in horror, cringing.</li><li><b>Involuntary combat action</b>—if a Sanity roll is failed during a combat round, the investigator’s action for that round may be dictated by the Keeper; for example, lashing out with a fist, squeezing a trigger, taking shelter behind someone else.</li><li><b>Freeze</b>—stare disbelievingly for a moment but take no action.</li></ul><p>A fumbled Sanity roll results in the character losing the maximum Sanity points for that particular situation or encounter.</p><p>Losing more than a few Sanity points at one time may cause an investigator to go insane, as described later.</p><p>When encountering one ghoul, the Sanity point loss is 0/1D6. It is the same when encountering multiple ghouls; the sanity effect is for the encounter rather than each ghoul seen.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><span>Harvey Walters follows a trail into a crypt, where he finds a ghoul feasting on forbidden fruits among the coffins. The Keeper calls for a Sanity roll. Harvey has 45 Sanity points and his player rolls 83—a failed roll. The Keeper describes Harvey’s involuntary gasp of horror. The player picks up 1D6, rolls a 4, and reduces Harvey’s Sanity points by 4 points (45–4 = 41 Sanity points remaining).</span></p></blockquote><h2>Maximum Sanity</h2><p>The threat of insanity in <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> characterizes the Cthulhu Mythos in a way that allows no compromise. Exposed to it, few sane humans freely choose the Mythos, for the Mythos is intrinsically loathsome and foul. The connection of Sanity points and Cthulhu Mythos skill points emphasizes the power of the Mythos, which corrupts and ruins by proximity and association.&nbsp;</p><p>An investigator’s Sanity points may rise and fall during play; however, they may never rise above the character’s maximum Sanity rating. Each investigator has a maximum Sanity point value that begins at 99. Knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos always lowers an investigator’s maximum Sanity points. Maximum Sanity points equal 99 minus current Cthulhu Mythos points (99–Cthulhu Mythos skill).&nbsp;</p><p>When gaining Cthulhu Mythos skill points, the player should decrease the investigator’s maximum Sanity by the same amount.</p><blockquote><p>Harvey Walters spends some time perusing ancient tomes, gaining 3% Cthulhu Mythos skill. His player adds 3 points to Harvey’s Cthulhu Mythos skill and decreases his maximum Sanity from 99 to 96.</p></blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

			"blobNotes": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Creating Your Investigator</h2><p>There is more than one approach to creating an investigator. Some people prefer to have an idea about the type of investigator they wish to create before rolling any dice, while others prefer to let the dice rolls guide their choices. What follows are the standard rules for creating investigators, with further options at the end of this chapter. More guidance is provided in <b>Chapter 10: Playing the Game</b>.</p><h2>The Steps</h2><p>Here are the five steps to creating an investigator:</p><ul><li><b>Step One: Generate Characteristics</b></li><li><b>Step Two: Determine Occupation</b></li><li><b>Step Three: Decide Skills and allocate Skill Points</b></li><li><b>Step Four: Create a backstory</b></li><li><b>Step Five: Equip investigator&nbsp;</b></li></ul><h2>Step 1: Generate Characteristics</h2><p>A characteristic is one of eight numbers that create the foundations for an investigator. In the game, each characteristic represents an aspect of an investigator—intelligence, dexterity, and so on. These identified quantities determine the relative capability of investigators and suggest ways for them to act and react during play.</p><p>Characteristic values are generated randomly by rolling two or more six-sided dice. Each rolled result is then multiplied by 5 to generate a percentage number that may initially range between 15% and 90%.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/97871162/x5CK1U6fe5T2RfGtADZMEg/med.png?1574719582\"><br></p><h3>Rolling Characteristics</h3><p>Initially write your results on a piece of scrap paper before writing them onto the investigator sheet as they may be modified by the age of your investigator.&nbsp;</p><p><b>STR (Strength): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 to generate the Strength characteristic.</b></p><p>Strength measures the muscle power of an investigator. The higher it is, the more the investigator can lift or tightly cling to something. This characteristic determines the damage an investigator inflicts in hand-to-hand combat. Reduced to STR 0, an investigator is an invalid, unable to get out of bed.&nbsp;</p><p><b>CON (Constitution): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 to generate the Constitution characteristic.</b></p><p>Constitution represents health, vigor, and vitality. Poisons and diseases may directly challenge an investigator’s constitution. Investigators with a high constitution often have more hit points—the better to resist injury and attack. Serious physical injury or magical attack might lower the statistic, and if constitution reaches zero, the investigator dies.&nbsp;</p><p><b>SIZ (Size): Roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5 to generate a Size characteristic.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Size averages both height and weight into a single number. To see over a wall, to squeeze through a small opening, or even to judge whose head might be sticking up out of the grass, use size. Size helps determine hit points and damage bonus and build. One might decrease SIZ to indicate the loss of a limb, though lowering DEX is more often the solution. Presumably if investigators lose all SIZ points they disappear—goodness knows to where!</p><p><b>DEX (Dexterity): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 to generate a Dexterity characteristic.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Investigators with higher Dexterity scores are quicker, nimbler and more physically flexible. A DEX roll might be made to grab a support to keep from falling, to move faster than an opponent, or to accomplish some delicate task. An investigator with zero DEX is uncoordinated and unable to perform physical tasks.</p><p>In combat, the character with the highest DEX acts first (see <b>Chapter 6: Combat</b>).</p><p><b>APP (Appearance): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 to generate an Appearance characteristic.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Appearance measures both physical attractiveness and personality. A person with high APP is charming and likeable, but may lack conventional good looks. Someone with APP of 0 is appallingly ugly, possibly with a wholly detestable demeanor, provoking comment and shock everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>APP may be useful in social encounters or when trying to make a good impression.&nbsp;</p><p><b>INT (Intelligence): Roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5 to generate an Intelligence characteristic.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Intelligence represents how well investigators learn, remember, analyze information and solve complex puzzles. An investigator with zero INT is a babbling, drooling idiot.&nbsp;</p><p>Intelligence determines the number of Personal Interest skill points (multiply INT × 2) allotted to a new investigator (see <b>Personal Interests</b>). INT also acts as the value for both Idea rolls and Intelligence rolls (see <b>Chapter 5: Game System</b>).</p><p>If the amount of INT seems to contradict another characteristic, that’s another chance for roleplaying and further defining your investigator. For example, an investigator with high EDU and low INT might be a pedantic teacher or a sideshow performer, someone who knows facts but not their meanings. Conversely, high INT and low EDU might mean ignorance—such as an uneducated farm boy, new to the Big City—however this person would not be dull-witted.&nbsp;</p><p><b>POW (Power): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 to generate a Power characteristic.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Power indicates force of will; the higher the POW, the higher the aptitude for, and resistance to, magic. An investigator with zero POW is zombie-like and without \"purpose,\" as well as being unable to use magic. Unless stated otherwise, POW that is lost during the game is lost permanently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sanity points (SAN) begin the game equal to the character’s POW. Sanity points are covered in more detail in <b>Chapter 8: Sanity</b>.</p><p>POW dictates the character’s number of \"magic points,\" which, unlike POW, can be spent and regenerated during play. Magic points are equal to one-fifth of POW (see <b>Chapter 10: Magic</b>).</p><p>The POW of ordinary characters and investigators rarely changes. However, those adroit in the mysteries of the magic of the Cthulhu Mythos may be able to increase their POW.&nbsp;</p><p><b>EDU (Education): Roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5 to generate an Education characteristic.</b></p><p>Education is a measure of the formal and factual knowledge possessed by the investigator, as well as indicating the time the investigator has spent in full-time education. EDU measures retained information, not the intelligent application of that information (see <b>Intelligence</b>, above). An investigator without EDU would be like a newborn baby or an amnesiac—without knowledge of the world, probably very curious and credulous.&nbsp;</p><p>An EDU of 60 suggests the investigator is a high school graduate, while a score of around 70 indicates a person with some college years. Those with an EDU greater than 80 have most likely conducted graduate level work and have a degree, as expected of a person who has been to a university of some kind. Note that sometimes a person with a high Education may not necessarily be schooled in the traditional sense, but rather may be self-taught and possess a highly studious and observant nature.&nbsp;</p><p>EDU is a factor in determining how many Occupational skill points (see <b>Occupation Skills</b>) an investigator begins with, and represents the investigator’s starting percentage for the Own Language skill. EDU is also used when making Know rolls (see <b>Chapter 5: Game System</b>).</p><p><b>Note: </b>From this point forward, any references to a characteristic are to the full value (dice roll multiplied by five). Any adjustments are made to that value.&nbsp;</p><h3>Do Low Characteristics Make Poor Investigators?</h3><p>Often in roleplaying games, the higher the player character’s characteristics, the better the chances for that character’s success in the game. However, in <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, low characteristic scores do not always mean that the investigator will be hindered and unable to perform as part of the investigator’s group. Often one or two low characteristic scores can help to bring the investigator ‘to life’ and feel more real—as opposed to some incredible superhuman!</p><p>Rather than rejecting a low roll, try to incorporate it into the overall makeup of your investigator. Perhaps a low dexterity means that the investigator has suffered some form of leg or hand injury while in the armed forces, or a low education is the result of never attending school and being forced to grow up on the streets.</p><h3>Luck</h3><p>When creating an investigator roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 for a Luck score. See <b>Chapter 5: Game System</b> for how Luck is used.</p><h3>Age</h3><p>A player can choose any age between 15 and 90 for their investigator. If you wish to create an investigator outside this age range, it is up to the Keeper to adjudicate. Use the appropriate modifiers for your chosen age only (they are not cumulative).</p><ul><li><b>15 to 19 years old:</b> Deduct 5 points among STR and SIZ. Deduct 5 points from EDU.

If the result is greater than your present EDU, add 1D10 percentage points to your EDU characteristic (note that EDU cannot go above 99).</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/97871578/IU36dfd_2DLRkH2FGWTDog/med.png?1574720098\"><br><i>The Horror in Clay</i></p><h3>Half and Fifth Characteristic Values</h3><p>Once the percentage values for each characteristic have been determined, the next step is to write in the half and fifth values for each characteristic on the investigator sheet, entering the values alongside the percentage.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Divide the percentage value by two, rounding down, and enter after the \"half\" percentage value.</li><li>Divide the percentage value by five, rounding down, and enter the \"fifth\" value after the half value.</li></ul><p>When a \"characteristic value\" is referred to in the text, this means the full value (highest number). Where half or fifth values are required, this will be clearly stated, normally called Hard (half value) and Extreme (fifth value) rolls.</p><p>Half and fifth are the only fractions used in relation to characteristics and skills in the game and all the numbers are calculated up front so that play is not hindered by mental calculations. <b>A Quick Reference Chart for Half and Fifth Values</b> can be found in this compendium.</p><p>Alternatively, an electronic investigator sheet that automatically does all the calculations for you is available from the <b>www.chaosium.com</b> website.</p><h2>Other Attributes</h2><h3>Damage Bonus and Build [STR &amp; SIZ]</h3><p>All investigators, Keeper-controlled characters and monsters have attributes known as \"Damage Bonus\" (DB) and Build. Larger and stronger creatures and humans do more physical damage than their weaker brethren.&nbsp;</p><p>To determine damage bonus, add STR to SIZ and look up the total on <b>Table 1: Damage Bonus and Build</b>. Each range of results correlates with a die modifier or dice roll. Build is determined using the same figures.</p><p>In hand-to-hand combat, add the indicated damage bonus modifier or roll to all the character’s blows, whether using a natural weapon, such as a fist, or a melee weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Build is used in fighting maneuvers and chases, and also to give a sense of scale (see <b>Fighting Maneuvers</b>).</p><blockquote><p>Someone with a combined STR and SIZ of 134 would add 1d4 to hand-to-hand damage rolls, while a weakling investigator whose combined value is only 70 would deduct 1 point from melee damage.</p></blockquote><h3>Table 1: Damage Bonus and Build</h3><table><thead><tr><th>STR=SIZ</th><th>Damage</th><th>Build</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2 - 64</td><td>-2</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>65 - 84</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>85 - 124</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>125 - 164</td><td>+1D4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>165 - 204</td><td>+1D6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>205 - 284</td><td>+2D6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>285 - 364</td><td>+3D6</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>365 - 444</td><td>+4D6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>445 - 524</td><td>+5D6<em></td><td>6</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>*Add an additional 1D6 to Damage Bonus and +1 to Build for each additional 80 points or fraction thereof.</span><br></p><p><b>Note: </b>Damage bonus is not applied to firearms attacks.</p><h3>Hit Points [CON &amp; SIZ]&nbsp;</h3><p>Hit points are used to track the cumulative damage inflicted upon an investigator, non-player character, or monster during the game, and indicate how long he or she can stay in the action before collapsing from pain, exhaustion, or death.</p><p>Figure out the character’s hit point total by adding CON and SIZ, then dividing the total by ten (rounding down any fractions).</p><p>The investigator sheet is designed to help the player keep track of hit points and wounds.

An occupation also reflects a particular investigator’s field of expertise, and so dictates which of their skills should be higher.</p><p>The actual occupation of your investigator will have limited effect during the game; it is simply a basis for your investigator’s starting skills and helping to define his or her backstory. Some occupations are typically Lovecraftian: Antiquarian, Author, Dilettante, Doctor of Medicine, Journalist, Police Detective, and Professor. Other occupations are not those you would normally find in a Lovecraft story, however they may interest particular players and be fun to play in a <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> game.</p><p>An occupation ties together a cluster of skills. For instance, in the sample occupations, Antiquarian encompasses: Appraise, Art/Craft, History, Library Use, Other Language, one interpersonal skill (Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, or Persuade), Spot Hidden, and one other skill of the player’s choice (to reflect something special or relevant about the investigator’s past). Some occupations include no free choices; others may have two or more.</p><p>Once you have chosen the occupation for your investigator, write it down on the investigator sheet and then make a note of the occupation's professional skills.</p><p>Sample occupations can be found in this compendium.</p><h2>Step 3: Decide Skills and Allocate Skill Points</h2><h3>Occupation Skills</h3><p>After you have chosen an occupation, calculate your occupation skill points using the characteristics specified alongside the occupation. Allocate the resulting total as percentage points among those skills listed for the occupation—your investigator’s professional skills. Points should also be allocated to Credit Rating within the range indicated for the occupation. Not all the skills need to have points allotted to them, however points left undistributed are lost. Note that each skill has a number in brackets next to it on the investigator sheet: this is the base chance of success in that skill, and any points allocated to that skill are added to this base number.</p><p>Write down the total points for each skill on the investigator sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance printed on the investigator sheet). The sheet also has space to write in the half and fifth values for each skill, allowing you to reference them quickly in the middle of a game. A <b>Quick Reference Chart</b> for half and fifth values can be found in this compendium. It is advised that you allocate occupation skill points and then personal interest skill points before writing in the half and fifth values alongside the full value for each skill, as personal interest skill points can be used to bolster occupation skills as well as other non-occupation skills (see <b>Personal Interests</b> following).</p><h3>Personal Interests&nbsp;</h3><p>Investigators also draw upon experience, skills, and knowledge gained from hobbies and other non-professional activities, called personal interests. Multiply the investigator’s INT × 2 and allot the points to any skills (which can include adding further points to occupation skills), except Cthulhu Mythos (unless otherwise agreed with the Keeper).&nbsp;</p><p>Write down the total points for each skill on the investigator sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance printed on the investigator sheet). The sheet also has space to write in the half and fifth values for each skill, allowing you to reference them quickly in the middle of a game. A <b>Quick Reference Chart</b> for half and fifth values can be found in this compendium.</p><h3>Weapons and Firearm skills</h3><p>Fighting and Firearms skills, and their various specializations, allow an investigator to use weapons. Personal interest or occupation skill points (if applicable) may be spent to raise any of these skills. When an occupation includes the skill of Fighting or Firearms, and no specialization is specified, it is up to the player to choose one or more specializations of that skill (see <b>Chapter 4: Skills</b>).</p><h3>Credit Rating</h3><p>An investigator’s starting Credit Rating is determined during character creation, based upon the investigator’s chosen profession (<b>Sample Occupations</b>). In play, Credit Rating determines the amount of money a character has available (<b>Table II: Cash and Assets</b>). Credit Rating also indicates the general living standards a person can afford, as well as indicating the character’s relative status in society (see <b>Credit Rating in Chapter 4: Skills</b>).</p><p>Your investigator’s Credit Rating skill begins at zero. The range of starting levels for each profession can be broad, and the level chosen should reflect the investigator’s rank in that profession. For example, \"criminal\" could be used as a profession for a poor lone pickpocket (Credit Rating 9) or for a wealthy gang boss (Credit Rating 90). Any number of skill points can be invested in Credit Rating within the recommended limits for that profession.&nbsp;</p><p>There are six living standards: penniless, poor, average, wealthy, rich, and super rich. Each one determines the lifestyle, type of accommodation, travel, and expenses that a person can comfortably afford on a day-to-day basis.</p><h3>When Choosing an Occupation, there are Some Things to Consider</h3><p>Try to have a picture in your mind about who and what your investigator is—your character concept. Look for occupations that suit this concept and add color to it. Remember, rolling up an investigator is all about building up a story of who you want to play in the game. Your characteristics, occupation, sex, and age all help to establish a fully rounded, ‘breathing’ investigator.</p><p>Look through the skills associated with each occupation and see which of these you like the most. Certain skills are likely to appeal to you more. Perhaps you want your investigator to be a man of action, leading you to choose an occupation with skills like Fighting, Climb, and Throw. Alternatively you might decide to create a more studious investigator, with skill in Library Use, Spot Hidden, and Psychology.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, you might want to consider your investigator’s occupation and skill set in relation to the other players and what kind of investigators they will be playing. Creating a balance of occupations means that the group has a good mix of skills that will benefit everyone. Depending on the style of game and scenario you will be playing, your Keeper might have certain occupations in mind for you to play. Discuss your ideas with the other players in order to build the most appropriate group of investigators for your game. After all, it will be somewhat strange for everyone to turn up with musicians when the scenario is set in the Antarctic!&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, it’s not what your investigator can or can’t do, it’s how you decide to ‘play’ your character that is really important, and that, above all, will often determine your enjoyment of the game!&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/97917287/11KIo5hURtj6wCHuwTGOaw/med.png?1574780322\"><br><i>An investigator is about to encounter the Cthulhu Mythos for the first time.</i></p><h2>Step 4: Create a Backstory&nbsp;</h2><p><i>Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter.</i></p><p>—H. P. Lovecraft, <i>The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward</i></p><p>Most of the ideas and abilities that make an investigator interesting and fun to play are a matter of choice—not necessarily dice roll results. Think about what personal history, friends, enemies, and achievements could have led your investigator to delve into the secrets of the Mythos.</p><p>There are ten categories listed on the back of the investigator sheet; try to write down at least one entry for the first six (Personal Description, Ideology/Beliefs, Significant People, Meaningful Locations, Treasured Possessions, and Traits). It’s not essential to have an entry for each category, but the more you are able to define, the more your investigator comes to life. Further entries may be added or existing ones altered during play.</p><p>The categories of Injuries &amp; Scars, Phobias &amp; Manias, Arcane Tomes, Spells &amp; Artifacts, and Encounters with Strange Entities may be written in during play. Of course, some investigators might start the game with a significant injury or scar if implied by your investigator’s history—if so, write it in.</p><p>An investigator’s background serves three functions in the game:</p><p>First, as a set of pithy statements that serve as a guide to roleplaying, helping to define your investigator and remind you how he or she relates to the world.</p><p>Second, they can be called upon during the investigator development phase for the recovery of sanity points (see <b>The Investigator Development Phase</b>).</p><p>Third, and perhaps most importantly of all, the corruption of the investigator’s background mirrors their loss of sanity and growing knowledge of the Mythos, as all that was once held dear becomes meaningless. During episodes of insanity, or as a result of major wounds, the Keeper may add or amend a background entry. Ultimately the investigator’s only connections to the world are madness and pain.</p><p><b>When crafting background entries, be specific, emotional and emphatic</b></p><p>Try to phrase each entry to emphasize its personal nature. For example, “my wife” identifies the subject, but tells us nothing about the nature of the relationship.</p><p><span>A)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Specify a name. Name the person or place, identify the item or concept.</span><br></p><p>B)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Attach a feeling. Start with positive or negative and build from there.&nbsp;</p><p>Make it intense, use love instead of like, use despise instead of dislike. Be emphatic; use must in place of would prefer. Try to phrase it in a way that makes it personal and meaningful.</p><blockquote><p>Consider “wife” as a starting point. Now give her a name, “My wife, Annabel.” Now be emotional “My beloved wife, Annabel.” Now be emphatic, “My beloved wife, Annabel. I couldn’t live without her.” That short journey delivers a lot more information and context. Of course it could have been developed differently, consider: “My wife Annabel, who makes my life a misery, “My poor wife Annabel, if only we could have a child together”.</p></blockquote><p></p><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/97872563/9voL8ztp2jt-yeTp8CstKA/med.png?1574720900\"></div><p><i>\"Dear, did you hear something outside?\"</i></p><p></p><h3>Using Random Tables for Inspiration</h3><p><span>Sometimes coming up with background details on the fly can be difficult. The following random tables provide a way to quickly determine some background details—you can either roll on the tables or simply pick ones that seem suitable, or just use the lists for inspiration.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>As appropriate, roll 1D10 on each of the following charts to select an entry for each category. Each option has some examples to get you started. Don’t feel constrained to use what you roll; if it doesn’t mesh with your character concept then roll again or choose a different option. However, don’t dismiss it out of hand; sometimes something that is at first incongruous will add an unexpected but welcome twist to a character.&nbsp;</p><p>Above all, be clear that the random tables are there as a springboard for your imagination. Each dice roll will give you something from that realm of life to react to; embrace it or reject it, but be sure to react to it and use it to help fuel your imagination. Weave the background together to make a credible all-round character.</p><blockquote><p>You might be creating a male investigator in his twenties, with no thought of any family. Rolling for ‘significant people’ indicates a child. You may not have considered that your character has a child, but why not? Becoming a father may not have been intentional. Consider the options; you may have had an affair with a married woman, your wife may have died and your child fostered, or you may be happily married with a family.</p></blockquote><h3>Personal Description</h3><p>Think of a distinct look that sums up your investigator’s appearance (APP).&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here are some possibilities (choose rather than roll):</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td>Rugged</td><td>Handsome</td><td>Ungainly</td></tr><tr><td>Pretty</td><td>Glamorous</td><td>Baby-faced</td></tr><tr><td>Smart</td><td>Untidy</td><td>Dull</td></tr><tr><td>Dirty</td><td>Dazzler</td><td>Bookish</td></tr><tr><td>Youthful</td><td>Weary</td><td>Plump</td></tr><tr><td>Stout</td><td>Hairy</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><td>Elegant</td><td>Scruffy</td><td>Stocky</td></tr><tr><td>Pale</td><td>Sullen</td><td>Ordinary</td></tr><tr><td>Rosy</td><td>Tanned</td><td>Wrinkled</td></tr><tr><td>Stuffy</td><td>Mousy</td><td>Sharp</td></tr><tr><td>Brawny</td><td>Dainty</td><td>Muscular</td></tr><tr><td>Strapping</td><td>Gawky</td><td>Frail</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/97872925/bxPANreHgwWuWdtaOaPmNw/med.png?1574721149\"><br><span><i>Some investigators find that a gun is a necessity.</i></span></p><h3><span>Ideology/Beliefs</span></h3><p>Roll 1D10 or pick one of the following.

This is their key connection: the one thing above all else that gives meaning to their life. Mark it with star or underline it on the investigator sheet. This connection can aid your investigator in regaining Sanity points (see <b>Chapter 8: Sanity</b>).&nbsp;</p><p>Everything in the story is open to the Keeper to do with as he or she desires, except for the investigator’s key connection. The key connection cannot be destroyed, killed or taken away by the Keeper without first allowing the player the opportunity to roll dice to, in some way, save that key connection.</p><p>The idea of the players being able to nominate something in the game world that has immunity may sound daunting (to the Keeper) at first. However, this immunity is quite limited; the key connection can be killed, removed or destroyed by the Keeper, but the investigator to whom they are connected must be involved, or given the option to become involved. In game play this means that the player must be presented with the opportunity to make at least one dice roll to save the connection.</p><p>Losing one’s key connection during play requires a Sanity roll (1/1D6 Sanity point loss, see <b>Chapter 8: Sanity</b>).</p><h3><span>Additional Details</span></h3><p>Fill in the following details on the investigator sheet.</p><h4>Birthplace&nbsp;</h4><p>Most of Lovecraft’s stories take place in New England. You can choose to start there if you wish; however, your investigator could originate from anywhere in the world. No game penalty or advantage exists for one country or culture over another. The choice can lead to other deductions: for instance, while an investigator born in the United States of America or Canada has a good chance of English as his or her own language, an investigator born in Quebec might learn French at infancy, while one born in Arizona might have Spanish or Navajo, and one born in San Francisco might speak Cantonese.</p><h4>Gender of the Investigator&nbsp;</h4><p>The investigator can be male or female. No game rule distinguishes between male and female; neither sex has an advantage over the other. Players are encouraged to play either sex based upon their preference rather than tactical considerations. Some published scenarios may consider the effect of gender in specific societies and historical periods.</p><h4>Name</h4><p>The name of the investigator is whatever the player finds entertaining or evocative. Fashions in names change over the decades, and certain names may fit one historical period and setting better than others.&nbsp;</p><h4>Picture&nbsp;</h4><p>A space exists on the investigator sheet for you to draw a picture of your investigator. If you prefer, you could cut out a suitable portrait from a magazine or print one from the Internet. It’s a useful way to introduce your investigator to the other players. Even a small picture can say a lot.&nbsp;</p><h2>Step Five: Equip the Investigator&nbsp;</h2><p>Your investigator’s day-to-day living standards are dictated by the Credit Rating score. The likelihood of owning major possessions, such as a house and a car, are also indicated by the Credit Rating score. The Keeper will advise on what other equipment an investigator may start out with. A player may buy additional items, if available for purchase.</p><h3>Cash and Assets</h3><p>The following amounts, in US dollars, by period, denote the wealth of an investigator. Cash is readily available to the investigator, whereas wealth that is tied up in assets can only be spent if time is taken to realize the capital.&nbsp;</p><p>Cross reference the investigator’s Credit Rating with the period to determine the investigator’s available cash, assets and spending level.</p><h4>Notes:</h4><p><b>Cash: </b>Not necessarily carried on the person. The Keeper may ask where it is being kept. For example, if the investigator is traveling abroad, are they keeping it in a money belt or is there someone back home who can wire money to them when requested. This will have an impact if the investigator is robbed or loses their gear.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Spending Level:</b> This is an arbitrary amount below which, for ease of play, no record keeping is required. A character can spend up to his or her spending level with no expenditure of cash. In theory an investigator could spend an amount just below their spending level every day, but in practice it should be used only occasionally—if the Keeper feels a player is exploiting this financial abstraction, a use of assets may be called for. The spending levels exist purely to ease the flow of the game; no one wants to track every penny.</p><p><b>Assets: </b>Assets are the things that your investigator owns at the start of play and the dollar amount on the chart is the total value of those things. The player should note down the dollar amount and decide the form it takes, usually property or investments, or perhaps shares in a business.&nbsp; The standard list of possessions is included within the various brackets of living standards. If your living standard includes a house and car, those things constitute a part of your asset value.</p><h3>Table II: Cash and Assets</h3><h4>1920s:</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Credit Rating</th><th>Cash</th><th>Assets</th><th>Spending Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Penniless <br>(CR 0 or less)</td><td>$0.50</td><td>None</td><td>$0.50</td></tr><tr><td>Poor <br>(CR 1-9)</td><td>CR x 1 <br>($1 - $9)</td><td>CR x 10<br>($10 - $90)</td><td>$2</td></tr><tr><td>Average<br>(CR 10-49)</td><td>CR x 2<br>($20 - $98)</td><td>CR x 50<br>($500 - $2450)</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td>Wealthy<br>(CR 50-89)</td><td>CR x 5<br>($250 - $445)</td><td>CR x 500<br>($25,000 - $44,500)</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>Rich<br>(CR 90-98)</td><td>CR x 20<br>($1800 - $1960)</td><td>CR x 2000<br>($180,000 - $196,000)</td><td>$250</td></tr><tr><td>Super Rich&nbsp;<br>(CR 99)</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$5M+</td><td>$5000</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span>Modern:</span></h4><table><thead><tr><th>Credit Rating</th><th>Cash</th><th>Assets</th><th>Spending Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Penniless<br>(CR 0 or less)</td><td>$10</td><td>None</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td>Poor<br>(CR 1-9)</td><td>CR x 20<br>($20-180)</td><td>CR x 200<br>($200 - $1,800)</td><td>$40</td></tr><tr><td>Average<br>(CR 10-49)</td><td>CR x 40<br>($400 - $1,960)</td><td>CR x 1,000<br>($10,000 - $49,000)</td><td>$200</td></tr><tr><td>Wealthy<br>(CR 50-89)</td><td>CR x 100<br>($5,000 - $89,000)</td><td>CR x 10,000<br>($500,000 - $890,000)</td><td>$1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rich <br>(CR 90-98)</td><td>CR x 400<br>($36,000 - $39,200)</td><td>CR x 40,000<br>($3.6M - $3.92M)</td><td>$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Super Rich<br>(CR 99)</td><td>$1 million</td><td>$100 million+</td><td>$100,000</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span>Equipment</span></h3><p>The final step is to write down any important items, weapons or equipment your investigator possesses. There’s no need to write a detailed list of everything your character owns—just list the notable items. In many cases, starting investigators don’t really have anything exceptional or worth writing down in the way of equipment—that’s fine as you’ll soon be uncovering all manner of strange and remarkable items during the game. Items that fit the profile of your investigator’s living standard do not need to be paid for—you simply own those.</p><p>Even if your investigator takes no weapons, he or she may still use them. Perhaps your investigator served in a war, or gained some familiarity with knives or guns while growing up on a farm. Few people in any era are expert with weapons, though often they have passing acquaintance with them. Except for a few occupations like Soldier, additional skill points for Fighting and Firearms normally come out of personal interest skill points.&nbsp;</p><p>Refer to the <b>Equipment lists </b>and <b>Table XVII: Weapons</b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

The Keeper rules that this constitutes a fighting maneuver (see <b>Fighting Maneuvers</b>) since it will clearly initiate a combat and it is similar in intent to disarming an opponent. The cultist’s DEX is higher than Harvey’s, but he is not aware of being in combat until Harvey acts, although he may anticipate Harvey’s action—see <b>Striking the First Blow (Surprise)</b>. Using the rules for surprise attacks, the Keeper asks for a Stealth roll from Harvey, setting the difficulty level as Regular (the cultist’s Spot Hidden skill is below 50). Harvey is successful and the cultist doesn’t see the attack coming.</p><p><b>Harvey’s surprise attack:</b><br><span>Harvey attempts to snatch the cultist’s case using a fighting maneuver.

The Keeper asks what Rodger is doing (see <b>Declaration of Intent: “What is your character doing?”</b>). Rodger’s player leans forward and tells how Rodger is going to grab the cultist from behind, keeping hold of him while Harvey punches the cultist’s lights out. The Keeper interprets this as a fighting maneuver with the goal of restraining the cultist. Both sides have equal Builds, so there are no bonus dice or penalty dice.

The cultist is making a fighting maneuver. Rodger is simply trying to keep his hold on the cultist. The hold will only be broken if the cultist wins the maneuver, otherwise the status quo will remain. The cultist has a penalty die as a result of being restrained (see <b>Fighting Maneuvers</b>).</p><p>Either 82 or 02 (penalty die) is rolled for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—the highest roll is used—a Failure.<br>Rodger rolls a 24 for his Dodge skill—a Regular success.</p><p>The cultist fails to break free. Neither side inflicts damage on the other.</p><p><b>Harvey’s action:</b><br>Harvey has the briefcase in his hands, and the cultist is restrained before him. Harvey uses the briefcase as an improvised weapon (see <b>Improvised Weapons</b>) to bash the cultist in the face. The Keeper decides to allow Harvey to use his Brawl skill for the attack. The cultist has already fought back this round (versus Rodger) and so Harvey gets a bonus die (see <b>Outnumbered</b>). The cultist attempts to dodge, but suffers one penalty die because he is being restrained.&nbsp;</p><p>Either 19 or 89 (bonus die) is rolled for Harvey’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.<br>Either 01 or 71 (penalty die) is rolled for the cultist’s Dodge skill—a Failure.</p><p>The Keeper decides the briefcase will do the same damage as a small club, 1D6. The cultist takes 3 points of damage.</p><p><b>Combat round two:</b><br>Other commuters are shocked at the conflict that is taking place, but no one steps forward to intervene.</p><p><b>Rodger’s action:</b><br>Rodger already has hold of the cultist, so he doesn’t need to roll dice unless he wishes to do anything in addition to continuing to hold him. Rodger decides he’s going to take advantage of his hold on the cultist to slam the cultist’s face against a nearby pillar. The cultist attempts to break free. Both sides will make a fighting maneuver roll. The cultist has one penalty die for being restrained.</p><p>Rodger gets a 49 for his Fighting (Brawl) skill—a failure.<br>Either 11 or 81 (penalty die) is rolled for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a failure.</p><p>Rodger fails to hurt the cultist and the cultist fails to break free. The cultist is still held and the two of them are struggling around the platform.</p><p><b>Cultist’s action:</b><br>Instead of struggling to break free, the cultist now raises his feet to waist height and pushes against the nearby pillar, attempting to overbalance Rodger onto the floor. Rodger continues to hold on and to resist being toppled. Since his goal is to avoid the attack, this will use Rodger’s Dodge skill. The cultist has one penalty die for being restrained.</p><p>Rodger gets 32 for his Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.<br>The Keeper rolls 03 twice (penalty die) for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—an Extreme success.</p><p>The Keeper rules that hitting the concrete floor is worth 1D6 damage (like a club) plus the cultist’s 1D4 damage bonus. Rodger takes the maximum of 10 points of damage as a result of the Extreme success (see <b>Determining Damage</b>). This drops Rodger’s hit points to 4. This is a major wound (see <b>Wounds and Healing</b>) and as a result Rodger is automatically knocked prone and must release his hold on the cultist. Rodger passes a CON roll and remains conscious.</p><p><b>Harvey’s action:</b><br>Harvey hates to leave his friend like this, but figures the cultist will probably chase after him, and so he flees the scene.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Combat round three:</b><br>Rodger is prone on the floor. The cultist is running after Harvey.</p><p><b>Rodger’s action:</b><br>No action has been taken against Rodger this round, so he is free to stand up and act. He draws a throwing dagger from his belt and throws it at the cultist’s back. This is a thrown weapon attack; the Keeper decides that the cultist will not be able to dodge it because he is unaware of the attack (see <b>Ranged and Thrown Weapons</b>), but Rodger still has to roll to hit.</p><p>A Failure is rolled for Rodger’s Throw skill. The dagger misses.</p><p><b>Cultist’s action:</b><br>The cultist uses his Dominate spell to command Harvey to, ‘Stop where you are”. The rules for magic and spells are covered later in this book, and all we need to know is that the spell fails. However Harvey, knowing that he is unlikely to outrun the cultist, chooses to pretend that he is under the cultist’s command; the player has an idea of her own…</p><p><b>Harvey’s action:</b><br>Harvey feigns being under the cultist’s command as his enemy approaches. Harvey’s player then asks if perhaps the train is pulling in at that moment? The Keeper hadn’t previously remarked upon the train and decides to allow a Luck roll to determine the situation. Harvey’s Luck roll is a success and the train is just pulling in as the cultist reaches to take the case from him. Harvey seizes the opportunity to push the cultist in front of the train, using the briefcase.<br>This action will require a successful fighting maneuver. The Keeper loves the idea and grants Harvey a bonus die for his clever manipulation of the situation. The cultist tries to take the bag, and the Keeper decides that his goal is to spin Harvey round and throw him before the train! Both sides are making a fighting maneuver. Harvey will take one penalty die because his Build is 1 point lower than the cultist’s. This cancels out the bonus die awarded by the Keeper.<br>08 is rolled for Harvey’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Hard success. 23 is rolled for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.</p><p>Harvey keeps hold of the case and pushes the cultist in front of the train; the Keeper doesn’t bother rolling for damage!</p></blockquote><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t",

			"blobNotes": "\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>When to Roll Dice</h2><p>There is a large amount of fun to be had playing a roleplaying game, and much of it is derived from discussing your character’s actions with your fellow players (and the Keeper) without rolling any dice whatsoever. Players declare what their investigators are doing and often speak \"in character\" to better express themselves. The Keeper states what the non-player characters (NPCs) are doing, and describes the world around the investigators. So far so good. Everyone accepts what everyone else says and builds upon it to create an interesting story. Until, of course, they don’t accept what someone else is saying. For example, an investigator doesn’t believe what Old Man Marsh (played by the Keeper) is saying about the whereabouts of the missing library books. When someone says something that you don’t like, you can ask for clarification or you can disagree—but ultimately, if you don’t accept what someone says about what’s happening in the story, the situation can be resolved with dice. Likewise, you could simply say that your investigator managed to climb to the top of the church steeple in the pouring rain at midnight—however if there’s no dice roll to test your investigator’s skill, there’s no tension or drama either!</p><p>Equally there’s no need to roll dice for everything. For example, each investigator has a Drive Auto skill, but dice don’t need to be rolled every time an investigator gets in a car—that would be just dull! If you say your investigator is driving to the local historical society, unless someone takes issue with you, then it’s done. Simply move on with the story. Normal day-to-day stuff that everyone \"just does\" should be just that—no dice needed.</p><p>However, if the Keeper describes a car full of cultists attempting to push the investigator’s car off the road, the player may object to this. The player could say, “Hold on, I’m putting my foot down and getting away,” but still the Keeper may insist the cultists are barging the investigator’s car off the road. There’s a disagreement, a conflict—a reason to roll dice and see whether the investigator’s car is indeed pushed into the ditch. The story has reached a moment of tension that requires a definite outcome. Time to reach for the dice!</p><h2>Skill Rolls</h2><p>The word \"roll\" is used in conjunction with the appropriate skill or characteristic; thus the Keeper will, for example, call for a \"Climb roll\" or a \"Strength roll\".</p><p>The Keeper has the final say about which skill or characteristic is appropriate to roll, depending on the situation and the nature of the opposition. The term \"skill roll\" is used regardless of whether a skill or a characteristic is used.</p><p><span>The player should be clear about what they want to achieve by stating a goal before rolling any dice. If the goal isn’t acceptable, the Keeper should help the player to rephrase it. The goal should define the player’s objective clearly and concisely. For advice on setting goals see <b>Chapter 10: Playing the Game</b>.</span><br></p><blockquote><p>Harvey Walters wants to force a door open. The Keeper might assume that he is simply bashing the door and creating a loud noise in the process. If Harvey wants to open the door quietly, he needs to state this as his goal. Thus ‘break the door down’ and ‘lever the door open quietly’ are two different goals, and the Keeper will consider the complexity of the goal when setting a difficulty level.</p></blockquote><h3>The Keeper’s Decision is Final</h3><p>While the Call of Cthulhu rules are designed to be as clear and flexible as possible, from time to time you may encounter a situation in the game for which the rules do not provide a solution. In such circumstances the Keeper’s decision is final. Players are encouraged to offer suggestions and ideas, however the players should respect the Keeper’s decision and move on with the game.</p><h3>Skill Roll:&nbsp;<span>Determining the Difficulty Level</span></h3><p>The Keeper determines the difficulty level for skill rolls. There are three levels of difficulty in Call of Cthulhu: Regular, Hard, and Extreme.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Regular difficulty level:</b> an average example of what would challenge a competent person. The player needs to roll equal to or below their full skill or characteristic in order to succeed. This should be used in the vast majority of cases.</p><p><b>Hard difficulty level: </b>this task would challenge a professional. The player needs to roll equal to or below a half of their skill or characteristic in order to succeed. This should only be used occasionally.</p><p><b>Extreme difficulty level: </b>this task would challenge an expert; it is on the border of what is humanly possible. The player needs to roll equal to or below a fifth of their skill or characteristic in order to succeed. This should be reserved for extreme situations.</p><p>If you, as Keeper, feel that the task is easy then don’t ask for a dice roll. Save dice rolls for challenging situations.</p><p>If the investigator is facing a living being, the difficulty level should be set according to the complementary skill or characteristic belonging to that being (human or otherwise). It is up to the Keeper to decide which skill or characteristic would be used by the opponent to counter the investigator’s actions—examples can be found with each skill entry (see <b>Chapter 4: Skills</b>).</p><ul><li>If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is below 50, the difficulty level is <b>Regular</b>.</li><li>If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is equal to or above 50, the difficulty level is <b>Hard</b>.&nbsp;</li><li>If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is equal to or above 90, the difficulty level is <b>Extreme</b>.&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote><p>Harvey Walters is trying to persuade the librarian to allow him access to the library on a Sunday, when the library is normally closed. The Keeper considers the librarian’s Persuade and Psychology skills (the two skills which are used to oppose Persuade). Neither of these is above 50% and so the difficulty level is Regular, requiring Harvey’s player to roll equal to or below Harvey’s full Persuade skill in order to succeed.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Harvey failed to persuade the librarian to open up, so he has decided to force open the back door of the library. Harvey has a STR of 20. The library door is made of thick oak, with a stout iron lock, and the Keeper judges it to be particularly strong. The difficulty level is thus set to Hard, requiring Harvey to roll 10 or below (half Harvey’s STR).</span></p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/97944601/SlSshMqcaiWB9RizPnIeew/med.png?1574806319\"><br><span><i>\"Sorry, the library is closed!\"</i></span></p><p><span>In the case of non-living opponents, the Keeper must act as judge, weighing up the pertinent factors. A standard challenge would be of Regular difficulty. Where the challenge is clearly beyond Regular difficulty, the Keeper may use the Hard difficulty level. If the challenge is exceptionally difficult but still within the bounds of what is humanly possible, the Keeper should use the Extreme difficulty level.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>Wherever possible, the situation should be framed in such a way that the dice are being rolled by the player. Players won’t get much fun out of watching the Keeper roll the dice every time. If the investigator is attempting to use their Stealth skill to furtively follow a non-player character, the player would roll the dice and the Keeper would use the non-player character’s Spot Hidden skill to set the difficulty level. If the situation were reversed and the non-player character were following the investigator, the player would roll the dice against their Spot Hidden skill to see if the tail is spotted, but this time Keeper would use the non-player character’s Stealth skill to set the difficulty level. Remember, the players should be rolling the dice more often than the Keeper.</p><p>See <b>Chapter 10: Playing the Game</b> for more advice on setting difficulty levels.</p><h3>Rolling the Dice: Success or Failure</h3><p>There are two possible outcomes of a roll: success or failure. The various divisions of skill (fifth, half, full) do not equate with graduations of success. The player states a goal and then rolls the dice. If the dice roll is equal to or below the required number, the goal is fully achieved. If the dice roll is below a half or a fifth of the specified skill, the goal will not necessarily be performed to a higher standard. Any further interpretation of the roll is at the discretion of the Keeper.</p><p>Remember, only roll the dice if it’s a moment of tension. Dice rolls are not needed when characters undertake mundane and everyday tasks.</p><h3>Success</h3><p>If the player has rolled equal to or under the target set by the Keeper, their investigator has achieved the goal that was set and agreed before the roll. The player should be encouraged to participate in describing the outcome. This can include aspects of the story beyond his or her investigator, such as the actions of non-player characters and the environment; however, such things may be moderated by the Keeper. Thus both player and Keeper are involved in describing the outcome of a successful roll.</p><blockquote><p>Harvey drives his car directly at a shambling human-like monster with the goal of hitting it. The Keeper declares that the difficulty level to hit it will be hard (given it has a Dodge skill of 60). The player rolls less than half of her investigator’s Drive Auto skill—a success! The player describes the scene...</p><p>“I push down the accelerator and ram into the shambling thing, knocking it flying. I brake hard, spin the car to a halt and jump out, leaving the engine running. I draw my pistol and fire three shots into the monster’s corpse.”</p><p>There’s no need to take issue with the player’s description of Harvey’s cool driving technique—it is just description—but did he really kill the monster? The Keeper checks the monster’s hit points and considers that it would take more than this to kill it. The player’s goal was to hit the monster with the car (which she did), not to kill it. The Keeper jumps in, slightly altering what the player has said...</p><p>“Great, but when you get out of your car and look around there’s no sign of a body; the thing you hit with your car is nowhere to be seen.”</p><p>Alternatively, the Keeper (referring to Other Forms of Damage) could ask the player to roll dice to see exactly how much damage the car did to the monster. Determining that the monster is definitely not dead yet, the Keeper amends the latter part of what the player said...</p><p>“As you reach for your pistol, you see the shambling thing emerge from the foliage. It looks undamaged and very, very angry.”</p></blockquote><h3>Failure</h3><p>The player stated a goal and has failed to achieve it, but exactly how the player’s investigator has failed is entirely up to the Keeper (though of course the players may throw in suggestions). Initial failure at a skill roll should not usually inflict damage or Sanity loss, but this depends on the circumstances. A failed roll could represent failure to act rather than a failed attempt. Worse things may happen if the player chooses to push the roll and fails a second time (see <b>Pushing the Roll</b>). Save \"what’s the worst that could happen?\" style consequences for pushed rolls.</p><blockquote><p>Harvey fails his Climb skill roll as he attempts to descend from an upper floor window to the street below. The Keeper describes the lack of handholds and that the nearby drainpipe feels loose. Harvey’s goal was to get safely to the ground, and this has not been achieved—Harvey is still stuck where he was before the dice roll. Note how the Keeper did not take the situation to its extreme, that of Harvey falling and suffering harm, as it made sense that Harvey would hesitate when he realized the danger.</p></blockquote><h3>Pushing the Roll</h3><p><i>...the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed—and, ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline’s debris as if no gulf had existed. Then I saw the chasm’s edge, leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength I possessed, and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniac vortex of loathsome sound and utter, materially tangible blackness.</i></p><p>—H.P. Lovecraft, <i>The Shadow Out Of Time</i></p><p>Pushing a skill roll provides the player with a second and final attempt to achieve a goal. A pushed roll is only allowed if it can be justified, and it is up to the player to do this. Whenever a player asks, “Can I push the roll?” the Keeper should always ask, “What action are you taking to push the situation?” It is not for the Keeper to simply say yes or no; it is for the player to describe the extra effort or time taken to justify the pushed roll. If the player is stuck, other players or the Keeper might offer suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p>By making a pushed roll, the player is upping the ante and giving the Keeper permission to bring dire consequences should the roll be failed a second time. Pushing a roll means pushing the situation to the limit:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span>If you are breaking down a door, it may mean throwing yourself at it with no heed for your own safety.</span><br></li><li>If you are persuading a police officer, it may mean risking arrest.</li><li>If you are searching a room, it may mean turning it over and risking breaking things, or spending too long there when you know the bad guys might return at any moment.</li><li>If you are trying to read someone with Psychology, it may mean studying a person that little bit too closely, or asking some very prying questions.</li><li>If you are picking a lock, it may mean using a little too much force. Something may break, but what will it be? The lock or your lock picks?</li><li>If it involves Cthulhu Mythos, you may risk staring into the abyss of dark knowledge for so long that something looks back at you.</li><li>If you are climbing a wall, it may mean continuing even though it feels completely unsafe.</li><li>If you are reading a tome, it may mean obsessing over every page, reading and rereading obsessively until you can correlate the contents.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that a pushed roll is not simply a re-roll; time always passes between rolls—it may be seconds or hours.&nbsp;</p><p>When making a pushed roll, the goal must still be achievable. The skill and difficulty level normally remain unchanged, but may be modified if the situation changes.</p><p>Only skill and characteristic rolls can be pushed, not Luck, Sanity, or combat rolls, or rolls to determine an amount of damage or Sanity loss.</p><blockquote><p>Harvey is fleeing from pursuing cultists. His player declares that Harvey is trying to hide behind a market stall positioned in the main street. The Keeper determines that this requires a Stealth roll at Regular difficulty. Harvey’s player rolls high and fails the roll. The Keeper describes the stall as being little more than a few boxes on the pavement, with nowhere to hide behind. Believing it’s only a matter of time before he is caught, Harvey decides to try to hide in plain sight, among the passing crowds, hoping that the cultists won’t see him in the throng of people. The Keeper approves this for a pushed roll. Harvey is taking a bigger risk—he’s effectively making himself easier to spot, and so will have no chance of escape if the pushed roll is failed.</p><p>Harvey’s player makes a second Stealth roll, this time succeeding! Harvey’s quick thinking means that he melts away into the crowd. The cultists have lost him this time!</p></blockquote><h3>Foreshadowing Failure</h3><p><i>So haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was&nbsp;<span>repeating them under his breath.</span></i></p><p>—H. P. Lovecraft, <i>The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward</i></p><p>Before rolling the dice for a pushed roll, the consequence of failure may be foreshadowed by the Keeper. To foreshadow, the Keeper says, “If you fail…” followed by as much detail as he or she desires. The Keeper should highlight things that would be apparent to the investigator (though perhaps unconsidered by the player). Things that the investigator would not be aware of might only be hinted at (at the Keeper’s discretion). Players are welcome to offer their own suggestions for consequences, especially when they come up with scarier ones!</p><p><b>There are two reasons why the Keeper should foreshadow the consequence:</b></p><ul><li>The player requests foreshadowing to clarify the dangers (as the investigator would be aware of them), so that they can gauge the risk.</li><li>The Keeper chooses to foreshadow to highlight the danger or to increase the drama of the situation.</li></ul><p>It is imperative that the Keeper focuses on an interesting consequence, rather than flat failure.&nbsp;</p><p>More advice on foreshadowing is offered in <b>Chapter 10: Playing the Game</b>.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/97948378/mSggkiLWbcwm_NGodRwmCQ/med.png?1574809965\"><br><i>\"Run! Run for your life!\"</i></p><blockquote><p>Using the previous example, Harvey’s player has declared she would like to try to push the failed Stealth roll and described what Harvey is doing to justify this. The player then asks the Keeper for the likely consequence if the pushed roll is failed. The Keeper thinks for a moment and says, “Well, as Harvey is trying to mingle with the crowd of people in the street—if the pushed roll is failed he could well find himself bumping into one of the pursuing cultists and be caught.”</p></blockquote><h4>Pushed Roll: Success</h4><p>The player’s goal is achieved as it would have been for the original roll. None of the consequences of failure happen.</p><h4>Pushed Roll: Failure</h4><p>Failing a pushed roll grants the Keeper free rein over the outcome, including damage, Sanity checks, loss of equipment, isolation from the rest of the investigators, capture, and so on. The Keeper can even incorporate the player’s goal being achieved (even though the player failed the pushed roll), but at some form of cost.&nbsp;</p><p>When a player fails a pushed roll, he or she is giving the Keeper license to make the investigators’ lives more difficult. A consequence should steer the game towards the theme of horror, taking the investigators one step nearer to their doom. A player gets to push a skill roll and, if he or she fails, the Keeper gets to push the horror back in that player’s face.</p><blockquote><p>In the previous example, instead of succeeding in the pushed Stealth roll let's say Harvey failed it. The Keeper now has license to make matters far worse for Harvey.</p><p>“As Harvey tries to blend into the crowd, he finds himself jostled as he goes against the flow of people. He is pushed against a market stall, knocking it and himself over (Harvey takes 1 point of damage). As Harvey falls to the pavement, fruit falling on his head, the sudden noise of his cry makes the crowd part around him. He looks up to see everyone staring at him, including the cultists who were in pursuit. They quickly shout out, “He’s our friend!” as they come forward and grab Harvey. The crowd of people seem satisfied, and no one notices the dagger that one the cultists is now holding to Harvey’s ribs as they manhandle him into an alley.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3>Failed Dice Rolls and Sudden Endings</h3><p>Where possible try to avoid an outcome that will end the game (unless you wish to, of course). Try to be creative and describe an outcome that allows for play to proceed, but not in the way the players intended. Rather than sudden death, consider other options such as:</p><ul><li><span>A setback: a loss of equipment or the death of an ally.</span><br></li><li>The investigator is taken captive rather than killed.</li><li>A deal: rather than killing the investigator, the enemy offers a pact or deal.</li><li>Fainting: it is perfectly Lovecraftian for a character to faint, only to awaken later to find themselves unharmed and the situation changed.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Harvey is fleeing through underground tunnels, pursued by ghouls. He sees an abyss before him. Perhaps he can leap across to the other side. He fails his Jump roll. There is really nothing he can do to push this roll. The Keeper could simply describe Harvey falling to his death, which would end the game for Harvey’s player. Alternatively, the Keeper could describe how Harvey falls and lands in an underground river, later to be washed up, injured and lost at an unknown location, his flashlight and equipment lost. The first outcome will bring the game to a sudden end and, while this may be acceptable, the second allows for the game to continue.</p></blockquote><h3><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/98126690/eyNljyegvl8x9okcdSc60w/med.png?1575045423\"><span><br></span></h3><h3><span>More Than One Player Rolling Dice for a Skill Roll?</span></h3><p>In some circumstances two or more characters may work together towards the same goal. The decision of how many investigators may be involved in a particular situation is up to the Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples include:</p><ul><li>Researching a single book: one person at a time may read the book.</li><li>Picking a lock: one person may attempt to pick the lock, rolling their Locksmith skill.</li><li>Delivering First Aid: two people may assist each other, both rolling their First Aid skill. A success is granted if either of them succeeds.&nbsp;</li><li>Carrying a body: the Keeper should use the SIZ characteristic of the body to set the difficulty level. Up to four people, each taking one limb, could assist one another in carrying a body, in which case a roll would only be required if the body were exceptionally heavy (see Physical Human Limits for guidance on combining physical characteristics).</li><li>Library Use in a public library: all investigators in the library may conduct research and attempt a skill roll. Only one successful roll is required.</li><li>Spotting a clue: everyone who is in the right position to view whatever is in question may roll Spot Hidden. Only one successful roll is required.</li><li>Determining if someone is withholding information: everyone who is able to observe the subject may roll Psychology. Only one successful roll is required.</li><li>Sneaking past a guard: Everyone needs to roll their Stealth skill; if one person fails, the guard will be alerted to their presence.</li></ul><p>The examples above are intended only as guidelines. For tasks in which the number of participants is limited, further attempts may be made by other investigators, but such attempts will take additional time.</p><p>It may not be apparent in some situations whether another skill roll should be allowed or if a player is required to push a skill roll; the Keeper must decide. In general, when an investigator is attempting the same goal a second time, this requires a pushed roll.</p><blockquote><p>The Keeper allows two investigators to administer First Aid to a fallen comrade. Each player rolls dice; if&nbsp; both fail the skill roll, they may either continue with their efforts (pushing the roll) or they can move aside and allow other investigators to attempt it (up to two at a time). Each attempt to administer first aid takes time, and this may be crucial if the patient is at death’s door.</p><p><b>Another example:</b> The players wish to interrogate a cultist, and decide to use the classic good cop, bad cop routine. One player uses Intimidate&nbsp; and another uses Charm. They take it in turns to play their roles, each rolling dice to test if the cultist cracks. Once the investigators have each made one dice roll, they must either give up, or one of them must push the roll.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

			"blobNotes": "<h2>Rolling Dice</h2><p><b>Dice Rule 1: The Keeper decides when to call for a skill roll.&nbsp;<br></b><span>You (as Keeper) decide on the difficulty level for each skill roll and, by extension, decide whether a skill roll is required at all. If the task is routine and no drama is involved then it doesn’t require a roll. There may be instances when you want the action to move on quickly or want to avoid adding complications to the proceedings and allow the players to do something difficult without a roll; as Keeper, this is your prerogative.</span></p><p><b>Dice Rule 2: Dice don’t tell stories; people do.<br></b><span>The dice do not decide what winning or losing means in your story; that’s the Keeper’s job. When a player wins a skill roll, his or her goal is achieved (as agreed before the roll), but when they lose, the Keeper decides what happens.</span></p><p><b>Dice Rule 3: Losing a roll doesn’t necessarily mean failing the goal.<br></b><span>There are two possible outcomes of a skill roll: win or lose. It is important to realize that losing a dice roll does not automatically lead to failing the task.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Things go the way the player wants when a Pushed skill roll is won (the player’s goal is achieved).&nbsp;</p><p>When a player loses in a Pushed skill roll things go the way the Keeper wants (the goal may or may not be achieved and additional negative consequences occur).</p><p>One of the keys to running a good game is learning to define how winning or losing a dice roll translates into events in your story. Describe the outcome, not the dice roll.</p><p>If the player loses the roll then you get to decide what happens. Problems can arise if you declare an outcome that blocks play.</p><p><b>Dice Rule 4: Dice are used to determine who tells the story.<br></b><span>On winning a skill roll, the player gets to say what happens next. What the player can say has already been agreed with the Keeper when the goal was set. If you feel that the player is overstepping the mark (going far beyond the stated goal) you may veto the player’s comments, perhaps calling for a subsequent dice roll.</span></p><p>If the player loses a dice roll, you have free rein to describe any outcome you wish. Usually this will mean that the player’s goal is not realized; however, you are not constrained to presenting the opposite of the player’s goal—the player’s goal could be fully or partially achieved along with a consequence. The Keeper’s job is to create an interesting outcome, preferably one that develops the theme of horror in the story.</p><p>One way to think of this is to compare it to a football game in which the two teams battle for possession of the ball. In <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> the player and Keeper battle for “possession” of the story. The side that wins the dice roll gets to run with the metaphorical ball for a while.</p><p><b>Dice Rule 5: Avoid consecutive rolls against the same skill.<br></b><span>Asking a player to make a skill roll more than once for the same task greatly reduces the likelihood of the player winning the roll. An investigator with a Stealth skill of 50% obviously has a 50% chance of winning (at Regular difficulty level). If the player is asked to make this roll twice in succession, the chance of passing both rolls drops to 25%. Therefore, if there are three guard posts and each must be passed to enter the cult base, rather than asking for three consecutive Stealth rolls, you could call for one roll to cover all three, allowing the one winning roll to stand so that no further rolls will be required for a time. If you feel that there being three guard posts makes the task significantly harder then you can raise the difficulty level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Dice Rule 6: Roll dice in full view.<br></b><span>Both players and Keeper should roll the dice in full view and use the result as rolled. If you find that dice rolls bring unwanted consequences, you should read through Dice Rules 1 to 4 again. The only exception to this is when the Keeper is making a “concealed roll,” such as for Psychology rolls (see <b>Contacts</b>).</span><b><br></b></p><blockquote><p>The investigators are locked in a room that is rapidly filling with water and have no hope of rescue. Their only way out is through a locked door. Andrew sets a goal for his investigator to “Pick the lock on the door”. He fails and feels compelled to push the roll. He does not request any foreshadowing—the consequence of being trapped underwater is self-evident. He loses a second time, placing the outcome in the Keeper’s hands. The group has only been playing for an hour and dying now would bring the session to a premature end. This presents a problem: the investigators are all going to drown if the door remains closed. The Keeper considers the options.</p><p>Devise a prompt rescue (which may feel like a contrivance).&nbsp;</p><p>Allow for some additional rolls (which of course might also be lost, leaving the players in the same situation).</p><p>Have the consequence of losing the Pushed roll be that the room fills with water, but just before everyone drowns, Andrew’s investigator manages to open the door and everyone is carried out on a wave of water.</p><p>Clearly the final option is preferable. The investigators should take some damage as part of the consequence, but they survive and the game goes on. The player has achieved his goal, but at a significant cost because he failed the Locksmith roll.</p></blockquote><h3>Setting Difficulty Levels</h3><p>The difficulty level of a given task should be the same for everyone and should not be altered according to the skill of the person attempting it. If the difficulty level for a climb is declared as being Hard it remains Hard regardless of whether one is a novice or an expert climber.&nbsp; The skill percentage is what makes the difference; the person with the greater Climb skill has a greater chance of winning the roll.</p><p>If you feel that a task is so easy that it would be routine, you can either not call for a roll (the task is simply accomplished) or you may ask for a roll at Regular difficulty (or give a Bonus die), but make the consequence of failure be very mild.&nbsp;</p><p>A routine task that relates directly to an investigator’s occupation should be achieved automatically; remember, only roll dice for important and dramatic reasons.</p><blockquote><p>Harvey’s player is trying to open a puzzle-box.&nbsp;</p><p>“Can I make an INT roll to try to open it”, the player asks.&nbsp;</p><p>“What are you actually doing with the box?”, asks the Keeper, prompting the player to elaborate.</p><p>Harvey’s player thinks for a moment. “I’m going to spend a while studying the various symbols, perhaps looking some of them up in my Uncle’s books, and see if I can figure out how to turn the various sides until it opens.”</p><p>“Sounds good. OK, give me an INT roll”.</p><p>Notice how the Keeper’s question coaxed some extra description and story from the player.</p></blockquote><h3>Ask the Player</h3><p>Ask questions of the players. Encourage the players to talk in terms of their investigators’ actions rather than using rules terminology. When a player proposes an action by asking to make a roll, ask questions about what the investigator is actually doing. It’s the Keeper’s job to ask the player to make a roll. Asking to make a roll does not convey the drama of the situation.</p><p>Encourage the players to describe the way in which their goals are achieved when they win the roll. Think of it as shining a spotlight on the player and placing a microphone under his or her nose. Don’t be unnecessarily restrictive when it comes to what you allow a player to narrate. With a goal of “breaking the door down,” does it really matter whether the player describes it as, “I force the door with my shoulder until the latch pops off,” or “I charge the door, smashing it asunder, sending splinters of wood flying across the room?” If it’s a matter of inconsequential details and the player has enjoyed describing his or her investigator’s actions, just smile and say, “Yes!” Try to avoid restating or rephrasing what the player just said—doing so is unnecessarily and may undermine the player’s contribution.</p><p>Some players may roll the dice and look at you to tell them what happens: “I rolled 14 to break down the door. That’s a success. What happens?” Throw the question back and encourage the player to elaborate. “Cool, tell us how you do it”.</p><p>Some players may go to the other extreme and describe everything that happens, including non-player characters’ reactions and more. How far you allow the player to go when it comes to describing how their goal is achieved is up to you. You have veto if the player goes too far, and you will develop a feel for what “too far” means.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn to differentiate between descriptive color and mechanical effect. How the player describes breaking down the door isn’t really important—it’s just color. The dice were rolled, the goal was achieved, and the door is broken down. From another point of view, this descriptive color is of utmost importance, as it is this description that builds the story and makes the game more interesting and fun.</p><p>There is only a mechanical effect on the game when the player goes beyond color and adds something that will affect future dice rolls. This is where you need to use your judgment on whether to accept, veto, or adapt the player’s description. If what the player asks for or describes seems reasonable, you can allow it, but don’t make life too easy for the player—remember that this is a horror game. You can veto it, but where possible try to adapt it or offer an alternative rather than blocking the player’s suggestion. If you feel unsure whether to allow it or not, you can ask for a Luck roll.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Harvey wins a skill roll to break a door down. The player describes Harvey’s actions thus: “I charge the door and smash it, sending splinters of wood flying across the room. There’s a guard there, right?” The Keeper nods. The player then says, “OK, the guard cowers and drops his weapon in surprise. I run over and grab the gun while he’s pulling splinters out of his face!”</p><p>You may feel that the player has gotten a little carried away here, but it’s creating good story. The Keeper decides to rewind the action a little to where the investigator is running at the guard, stating, “The guard sees you coming and makes a grab for his fallen weapon as he rolls away from you. Sounds like you’re trying to get it before him, right?”</p><p>Bang—it’s an exciting action scene. All that’s happened is that the player has achieved his goal of getting through the door and is now grappling the guard. The only thing that the player’s description really added was that the guard has dropped his weapon and the Keeper feels this is acceptable in the circumstances. The guard would normally have to draw a weapon, so either way the weapon is not in the guard’s hand at that moment. The whole thing about the splinters in the guard’s face is just color and has no effect on the dice or hit points.</p></blockquote><h3>Pushing the Roll—Pushing the Horror</h3><p>Sometimes, a player will simply ask, “Can I push that?” Remember the advice—ask questions of the players. Players must always describe the extra effort or action their investigators make to justify a pushed roll—if it sounds insufficient then suggest what more might be done. A pushed roll should usually be possible, but events in the story must account for it.&nbsp;</p><p>When a player loses a pushed roll, he or she is giving you, the Keeper, license to make the investigators’ lives more difficult. You should think of a consequence that takes the investigators one step nearer to their doom. It may be some unexpected occurrence, perhaps even one that is unrelated to the subject of the skill roll.</p><p>The consequence should be more than failure. Every time a player loses a pushed roll, you should try to steer the game towards the theme of horror. This may not always be possible, but have that as your goal: <i>a pushed roll is your chance to push the horror.</i></p><blockquote><p>Matthew asks a hotel receptionist if a certain person has stayed at the hotel recently. After failing initially, he refuses to take no for an answer and offers a bribe. The Keeper grants a pushed roll. Thinking fast, the Keeper foreshadows the consequence: “Your persistence may cause offense, perhaps more.” It’s vague, but it’s what the investigator might expect. Matthew fails the pushed roll and the Keeper considers how to make life more difficult for the investigator and push the horror theme. Up to this point the Keeper had not considered the receptionist but, as a result of this pushed roll, the Keeper decides that the receptionist is allied with the investigator’s enemies and will inform them of the investigator’s enquiry. To increase the tension, the Keeper hints at this within the consequence. “The receptionist holds up his hands and with a slight smile says, ‘I’m sorry sir, I’ve never heard of this gentleman’. A few moments later, as you’re leaving the hotel, you see him speaking on the phone. You catch his eye and he looks away hastily.”</p><p>Notice that the receptionist had not been considered a threat until the player lost the pushed roll. It was only then that the Keeper changed the status of the receptionist, adding yet another pawn to the enemy.</p></blockquote><p>Alternatively, if the investigator is insane at the time of losing the pushed roll then this presents a prime opportunity to introduce a delusion:</p><blockquote><p>If in the example above, Matthew’s investigator were insane, the Keeper might pick an alternative consequence, choosing to hit Matthew’s investigator with a delusion. “The receptionist is clearly losing his patience with you. He informs you again that he knows nothing of the person of whom you are enquiring. As he loudly states the name, you notice another guest staring hard at you. Something writhes beneath his shirt. His skin is slick with sweat, his eyes are fixed on you and he is mumbling something you can’t quite make out and making strange movements with his left hand.” In reality this is just another mundane guest at the hotel, however Matthew (the player) doesn’t know that and (suspecting a delusion) asks for a reality check (see <b>Reality check rolls</b>). He fails the roll, sending his investigator into a bout of madness. The Keeper decides that, during his bout of madness, the investigator attacks the innocent bystander until he is restrained by hotel staff, who then summon the police. The Keeper tells Matthew that the next thing his investigator is aware of is lying on the floor, pinned by a police officer’s knee, while nearby a man’s beaten body is being attended to by hotel staff. He has a lot of questions to answer.</p></blockquote><h3>Verbal Conflicts</h3><p>Verbal confrontations should be roleplayed at the table with much gusto and performance. However, when there’s a genuine conflict, you will want to pick up the dice. See <b>Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, and Persuade Skills: Difficulty Levels</b> for further details.</p><p>You must decide when a non-player character can be coerced and when they cannot. It might require a pretty face, a threat, a bribe, and so on, but most people can be won over with the right approach. Even the most evil of cultists might be conned or succumb to threats or persuasion if the players somehow find the non-player character’s weakness. Always work within the confines of the story—the cult boss would not knowingly be persuaded of anything by someone who is clearly an enemy, but if the investigator inveigles their way into the cult, they might stand a chance.</p><blockquote><p>Hasna has taken a cultist captive and tries to get him to reveal the cult’s plans. The Keeper asks what Hasna is doing to elicit information from the cultist and it soon becomes clear that intimidation is being used rather than persuasion. The cultist has low Intimidate and Psychology (both below 50%), so the difficulty level starts at Regular. Given the cultist’s motivation, the Keeper raises the level of difficulty to Extreme. There is a slim that chance the cultist will crack!</p><p>In this case, Hasna’s goal is possible as the cultist is relatively ineffective; however, if the cultist had an Intimidate or Psychology skill over 50%, the initial difficulty level would be Hard, and by raising the difficulty level by two steps the goal would become impossible. In that case the cultist would not crack unless Hasna could do something to “up her game,” such as using threats of, or actual, violence (in the case of Intimidate).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3>Violence and Sanity Rolls</h3><p>Intimidation may use threats of physical violence. One suggested consequence of losing a pushed Intimidation roll is to have the investigator unintentionally carry out his or her threat. The player may not want to shoot the non-player character in the kneecap, but pushing the roll can result in unwanted outcomes. The use of such violence in that situation would constitute torture, and the Keeper may wish to ask for Sanity rolls for the participating investigators.</p><p>Taking a life in a game is easy—we grew up doing it in make-up games as children, we do it in video games, we watch it on television, and so on. Actually doing it in real life is a whole other matter. You may wish to reflect this in your game by calling for a Sanity roll (SAN 0/1D6) when an investigator first kills a person, whether or not it is in cold blood.</p><p>Cold-blooded murder is especially difficult, and an investigator may find themselves incapable of doing it. Such callous behavior may require the player to fail a Sanity roll before they are able to pull the trigger on a fellow human being. There is, after all, a word for people who can carry out such acts without flinching—psychopaths. A psychopath would have a low Sanity and thus be able to do such acts without their conscience stepping in to prevent them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",
